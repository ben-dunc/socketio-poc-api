# POC for SOCKET io
The API for a proof of concept with socket.io for my work at the Missionary Training Center. Its purpose was to show that socket.io would work for a planned feature.

This experience turned out to be incredibly useful. Not only did it introduce me to the basic concepts of express.js (which socket.io is built off of) but also to web sockets. While this was an initial prototype that was made in 2021, it proved to be effective.
